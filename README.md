# Shutup Telegram Bot (To be renamed)

A modular bot made at first for personal use but gradually turned into a general use python bot anybody can use. just change the relevant settings in .env (This is still not completely implemented)

# Modular

Adding modules is easy. look at existing modules or exampleModule.py for some guidance. each module has a doc at the top that is automatically picked up by the bot.
